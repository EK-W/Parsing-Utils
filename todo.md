- Make scheme not need to be specified for each declaration
- Make ruleType into a struct that has function pointers for print, printdeep, parse, and free
- Make the token parse rule type
	- This requires adding a parameter to the parse function
- Make ParseRules store their data directly instead of a pointer to their data
	- This would essentially make schemes only useful for keeping track of allocations. So maybe modularize that functionality in a utility class.
- Make a caseInsensitive rule type? Or something?
- Do null checking in the create methods
- Make string/alphabet rules copy the strings
- Create an end-of-file rule
